# Evaluation Weights

Written on 3-12-2021

Megalodon now contains customizable options for
material and center control evaluation weights.

They are expressed as a percentage from 0% (evaluation category off)
to 1000% (10x normal evaluation).

To change the options, use these commands:

```
setoption name EvalMaterial value 10
setoption name EvalCenter value 250
```
